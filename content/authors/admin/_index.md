Back in the day, I studied geology due to my interest in the natural world. While I am no longer in that field, I wouldn't change anything due to the skills studying the earth taught me. Studying geology requires strong spatial skills and a system thinking, both of which I apply in my work every day. After studying geology, I worked as an informal educator, working with elementary aged students to teach them about the natural world. This inspired me to pursue a Master's in Geoscience Education Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

As many of us have these days, I took a bit of a circuitous path before getting into analytics. Growing up, I had always thought I wanted to be a scientist - I wanted to learn how to answer all the questions I had about the world. This changed my senior year of college, when I was researching student diversity through historical records. I was blown away by the amount of information that was out there and what trends could be uncovered with a relatively simple analysis. 

Years later, this has grown into a fully-fledged career. I have continued on the path of discovering answers to my questions (but with data instead of scientific research). My strength lies in turning questions into actionable research and analyses. I enjoy being part of all aspects of the analytics cycle - from developing questions to crafting thoughtful and digestible reports. 

I recently moved to Toronto, Ontario and have lived across the US, including in Colorado, Washington and Minnesota. When I am away from the computer, you can usually find me on a hike with my husband and dog, Biscuit, or listening to an audiobook while trying to figure out how to keep my plants alive.
